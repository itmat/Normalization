### About PORT
PORT is a resampling based read-level normalization and quantification pipeline for RNA-Seq differential expression analysis and it offers two types of normalization: __GENE Normalization__ and __EXON-INTRON-JUNCTION Normalization__.

-----------------

### Running PORT
Please see the [PORT wiki](https://github.com/itmat/normalization/wiki) for usage, input/output files and an explanation of the pipeline.<br>
>PORT is designed to be run on a compute cluster. It has been tested on SGE and LSF.
