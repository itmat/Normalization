# PORT 
## Pipeline Of RNA-Seq Transformations
**#RNA-Seq** **#Normalization** **#Quantification**<br><br>
**PORT** offers two types of normalization: <br>__GENE Normalization__ and __EXON-INTRON-JUNCTION Normalization__.<br>

-----------------

### About PORT
PORT is a resampling based read-level normalization and quantification pipeline for RNA-Seq differential expression analysis.

-----------------

### Running PORT
Please see the [PORT wiki](https://github.com/itmat/normalization/wiki) for usage, input/output files and an explanation of the pipeline.<br>
>PORT is designed to be run on a compute cluster. It has been tested on SGE and LSF.
